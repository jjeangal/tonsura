#### Mission: Allowing everyone to share music together even when they have bad taste for streaming platforms

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration 

**Sharing music can be **annoying*** On September 22, 2022, Jean tried to send Alex his favorite playlist on Spotify

* After correctly getting the right link to share, Alex was unable to open it because she uses Deezer
* Alex felt sad about not being able to listen to Jean's playlist
* This kept happening over and over among various group of friends and family 

And this is just one example, arguably a very impactful one in Alex and Jean's lives. So how do we ensure this never happens again? With **Tonsura**! ðŸ¤–
